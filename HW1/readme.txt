Hello, Welcome user, to my short minigame. Your goal is to get your player safely to the police car waiting for you. Your goal is to not get caught by one of the infected traveling about.

instructions to play:
Use your w-a-s-d ( up- left - down- right) to control your player.
This is a turn based game so you can only input one w a s or d at a time, then press enter to finish your turn. Every time you move , an infected will move too! So watch out.

Details:
This game has minor graphics, running across a green field away from zombie characters to a police car. ( Graphics may not work for windows users).
This game also has multiple zombies so watch out!
